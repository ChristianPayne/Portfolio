                    The Genesis Wheelstands were developed to add an interactive experience to the auto show floor. These apps had all the content needed to make sure the customer was well informed about the car they were looking at. There are a total of 5 different cars inside the same app that can be selected depending on what car the app is in front of.

                    The development team behind the interactive experience was Related Grey, ARTS4ALL (A4A) and myself. The wheelstands were made using Unity3D and deployed on Surface tablets. They are still out and about at auto shows therefore are still being maintained and updated.
