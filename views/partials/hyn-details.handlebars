                    Much like the Genesis Wheelstands, the Hyundai Wheelstands had all the cars in one app. This app has anywhere from 12-16 cars built into it that can be configured and displayed on the fly. Though each individual car is uniform with the others in terms of layout, they each have different images and spec sheets that are unique to the car on display.

                    The development team behind the interactive experience was Related Grey, ARTS4ALL (A4A) and myself. The wheelstands were made using Unity3D and deployed on Surface tablets. They are still out and about at auto shows therefore are still being maintained and updated.
